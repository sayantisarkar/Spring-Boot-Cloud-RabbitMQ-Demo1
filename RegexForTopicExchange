Topic Exchange Regex Standard
===============================
The routing key must be a list of words, delimited by a period (.), 
examples are agreements.us and  agreements.eu.stockholm  
which in this case identifies agreements that are set up for a company with offices 
in lots of different locations. 
The routing patterns may contain an asterisk (“*”) to match a word in a specific position 
of the routing key (e.g., a routing pattern of "agreements.*.*.b.*" only match routing keys 
where the first word is "agreements" and the fourth word is "b"). A pound symbol (“#”) indicates 
match on zero or more words (e.g., a routing pattern of "agreements.eu.berlin.#" matches any routing keys 
beginning with "agreements.eu.berlin").
